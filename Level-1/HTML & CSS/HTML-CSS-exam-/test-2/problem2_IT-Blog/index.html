                <p>Last fall, work on my coding side projects came to a head: I wasn’t making adequate progress and I couldn’t find a way to get more done without sacrificing my ability to do effective work at Khan Academy. There were a few major problems with how I was working on my side projects. I was [...]</p>

                <p>First, some background: I highly recommend that you read the following two blog posts: by Ashe Dryden: The Ethics of Unpaid Labor and the OSS Community and by James Coglan: Why Github is not your CV.

                <p>This summer I had the opportunity to attend NodeConf and it was a fantastic experience. I really appreciated how every session was a hands-on coding session: I felt like I walked away knowing how to put a bunch of advice directly into practice. One of my favorite sessions was the one run by James Halliday [...]</p>
